# **Public Policy Document Version Management with S3 Versioning**

## **Domain**: Government and Public Sector

### **Problem Statement**
Government agencies frequently revise public policy documents, and without a structured way to manage these revisions, it becomes difficult to ensure transparency, accountability, and an organized history of changes. Public consultations and revisions require a reliable system to track the history of documents.

### **Challenges**
- **Managing Multiple Drafts**: Public policies undergo frequent revisions, making it challenging to track different drafts and their changes.
- **Lack of Visibility**: Without version control, it’s hard to see what changes were made between drafts, leading to confusion and lack of clarity.
- **Integrity During Public Consultation**: It is vital to ensure that documents cannot be altered without proper authorization during public consultation phases.

### **Solution Overview**
This solution implements **S3 Versioning** to store, track, and manage versions of public policy documents. By enabling version control, this ensures transparency, accountability, and allows easy comparison of changes between drafts. 

### **How It Solves the Problem**
Versioning ensures that all drafts and policy changes are tracked. The system allows public policy makers, government employees, and the public to access earlier drafts, compare changes, and verify document integrity at any stage of the revision process.

## **How We Will Solve the Problems**

1. **Enable S3 Versioning**: Store all policy documents (drafts, revisions, and final versions) in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled to ensure all changes are automatically tracked.
2. **Create Comparison Tools**: Build an interface to review and compare document versions, enabling users to clearly identify changes made between drafts.
3. **Access Control Management**: Implement access management to control who can edit, view, or approve versions, ensuring the integrity of documents during public consultations.

## **Features**
- **Version Control for Policy Documents**: Automatic tracking of all versions of public policy documents to ensure no edits are lost.
- **Metadata Tracking**: Record important information about each document version such as author, date, and revision history.
- **Version Comparison Tools**: Allow users to compare versions side-by-side to highlight changes between drafts.
- **Centralized Storage**: All documents stored in an S3 bucket, providing a secure and organized system for managing policy revisions.

## **How It Works**

1. **Store Drafts in S3**: Each draft or policy version is uploaded to an S3 bucket with versioning enabled.
2. **Track Revisions**: With every update to the policy document, S3 Versioning automatically saves a new version of the document.
3. **Review and Compare Versions**: A web interface will allow users to compare different drafts to see what changes were made over time.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Set Up S3 Versioning**
Enable versioning on the S3 bucket used to store public policy documents with the `enable_versioning.py` script.

```bash
python enable_versioning.py
```

### **Step 2: Upload Policy Documents**
Users upload drafts, revisions, and final versions to the S3 bucket using the `upload_policy.py` script. Each change will be automatically stored as a new version.

```bash
python upload_policy.py
```

### **Step 3: List Policy Versions**
Users can view a list of all versions of a particular document using the `list_versions.py` script.

```bash
python list_versions.py
```

### **Step 4: Compare Policy Versions**
The `compare_versions.py` script will allow users to visually compare the differences between two different versions of the same document.

```bash
python compare_versions.py
```

## **Versioning Pipeline Development**

1. **Enable S3 Versioning**: Configure the S3 bucket to automatically track all changes to public policy documents.
2. **Build Version Comparison Tools**: Implement a user-friendly interface that highlights the changes made between different drafts or revisions.
3. **Version Control Access Management**: Implement role-based access to ensure that the integrity of documents is maintained during public consultation periods.

**Collaborating with Praveen**: Work with Praveen to integrate this system with public consultation platforms to streamline the revision process and ensure the community can easily track policy changes.

---

## **Further Improvements**
- **Integration with Public Consultation Portals**: Sync with public consultation systems to allow citizens to see changes and offer feedback.
- **Version Comparison for Amendments**: Enhance the comparison tools to support detailed comparison of policy amendments during consultations.
- **Audit Trails for Changes**: Implement an audit trail system to track who made changes to the documents and when.

## **Conclusion**
This solution leverages **S3 Versioning** to ensure that government bodies can effectively manage, track, and compare versions of public policy documents. It maintains transparency, accountability, and integrity during the public consultation and revision process.
